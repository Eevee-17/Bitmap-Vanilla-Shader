This shader is a post-processing shader.
**It only works when graphics is set to _Bitmap_** _(fabulous!)_

This vanilla shader is a resource pack and works with vanilla Minecraft; _no mods needed_!

The whole world of Minecraft is shown in a bitmap style (only black and white pixels). Different shades are interpreted by you with dithering. This vanilla shader adds an interesting and artistic style to the game. You can even use this shader to add a little bit of difficulty and fun to building because it removes the big need for color and instead pushes more for shapes and shading!
